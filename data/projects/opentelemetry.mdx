OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that helps IT teams collect and export telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces, for analysis and understanding software performance and behavior. It provides a unified way of instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data.

I've contributed to the OpenTelemetry ecosystem, helping to improve its capabilities for monitoring and observability in cloud-native environments.

Key features:

- Unified APIs and SDKs for multiple languages
- Seamless integration with cloud platforms
- Vendor-neutral data collection
- Distributed tracing and metrics collection
- Automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks

Meshery is the open source, cloud native manager that enables the design and management of all Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications. It provides a comprehensive platform for multi-cloud Kubernetes management with powerful features for service mesh deployment, configuration, and performance testing.

As a contributor to Meshery, I've helped develop and improve its capabilities for managing cloud native infrastructure and applications across multiple clusters and providers.

Key features:

- Multi-cluster management for Kubernetes environments
- Service mesh lifecycle management
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Configuration validation and policy enforcement
- Visual topology and service mesh visualization

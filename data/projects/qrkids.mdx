Created a web application that helps parents generate artistic QR codes containing their child's information that can be attached to their bags or clothing. When scanned, these QR codes provide the child's contact details to help reunite lost children with their families.

Used generative AI to create visually appealing QR codes that blend into designs while remaining scannable. Implemented with Streamlit for the frontend UI and Azure Blob Storage for hosting generated PDF files containing child information.

The project was published in the International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering.

Built a cloud-based, end-to-end solution for manipulating INSAT satellite data, tailored for meteorologists and scientists at ISRO. Contributed to the data processing pipeline by projecting Level 1 INSAT-3DR data and converting it into cloud-optimized GeoTIFF formats. Implemented download functionality and API playground to stream data directly into notebooks.

Won Smart India Hackathon 2024 for Problem Statement SIH1738: "Innovative applications of cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs for INSAT satellite data." Received guidance directly from ISRO scientists and had the opportunity to meet Nilesh M. Desai, Director of SAC ISRO.

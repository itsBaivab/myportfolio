Received the Most Active Student Award in both Curricular and Extracurricular Activities at JIS Sanman 2025. This prestigious award recognizes students who excel not only in academics but also actively contribute to campus life through clubs, events, and community service. The award highlights my commitment to a well-rounded educational experience and leadership within the JIS College community.
